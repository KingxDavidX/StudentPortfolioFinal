					<h3>"We all make choices in life, but in the end our choices make us." -Andrew Ryan From BioShock
					</h3>
					<p> I have put a lot of thought into my life after graduation, I have thought of situations ranging
						from Military service to coding for banks and government contracts. The military has become more
						and more unappealing as I grow, and I would be lucky to code and work for the government. But
						what I have become more and more interested in is banking and the financial field as a whole.
						They pay great and I would be able to do it remotely. I would just have to worry about
						staying updated with the newest and greatest coding languages. This isn't terrible for me
						especially because I enjoy learning new coding concepts. I plan on learning for my entire life.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is all vegue becuase I honestly dont know what the future holds. I just want a job that
						pays good enough that I can live comfortably and do things I enjoy. If I can do those two things
						and not have to worry about an unexpected expense making me go into the negative then I will be
						happy. If a job takes me out of the country or out of the state or anything I will do it. I am
						not really tied to a state or anyone, I am free to go where I want.
