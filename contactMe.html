					<p>
						My name is Davian Hernandez, I was born in Silver City, New Mexico. I was raised in Deming,
						New Mexico. I am currently in <strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong> for college. I am a
						full-time
						student at Neumont College of Computer Science. I was brought here because of my passion for
						tech.
						Ever since I got my first gaming console I wanted to learn how they were built and how they
						work.
						This led me to learning how to build a PC at <strong>15</strong> and learning to code not long
						after.
						Now I know how to code in Java, C++, C#, and Python. I am currently in the process of learning
						database software. I know how to use SSMS and am currently learning Redis. This is
						<strong>NOT</strong>
						the end of my studying, I want to learn even more languages and databases.
